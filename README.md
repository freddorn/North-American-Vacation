View website on [Github Pages](https://freddorn.github.io/north-american-vacation/)

North American Vacation is a travel planning webite for the United States, Canada and Mexico. Travelers can view where to stay,
the restaurants and bars nearby and tourist attractions in the area. The website will help the vacationer be aware of what is
available in the location they want to visit, so they can research and evaluate all the different possibilities.


## UX

The site is a single page where users can plan their trip in the United States, Canada or Mexico. It is presented in an
easy to use format with two banner images of North American places. The site features an email contact form to contact
us, if the traveler has any questions.

 ### User Stories
